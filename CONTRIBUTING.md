# Library Management System

## INFO 📜📜

**This app was made a year ago so a lot of flutter packages and elements are now deprecated.**

There are 2 things you can do:

- Fix The Deprecated Elements _[Don't Change the basic code structure of the app]_

- Add Cool UI Elements or fix the current obsolete elements.
